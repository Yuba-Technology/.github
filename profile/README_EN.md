We focus on the development of barrier free software systems. We firmly believe that the progress of science and technology is to **help everyone better**, which is the humanistic feelings and essence of scientific and technological innovation.

In 1487, Leonardo da Vinci drew the painting of the Vitruvian, hoping to express the perfect human proportions.

More than 500 years later, engineers developed the "Auxiliary Function" technology, hoping to make everyone a perfect person.

However, whether we are perfect or not, please remember that we humans are just supporting each other through this life.
